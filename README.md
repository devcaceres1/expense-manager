## Expense Manager

Expense Manager was designed to do all the boring work for us. Well not all since you still have to input the information yourself :/.

## Installation

Clone down this repository. You will need Node, and Npm installed globally on your machine.

You will also need to install Axios, React, Springboot, React-router-dom, and Bootstrap.

Installation:

npm install

```
npm install axios
npm install react

```

## Usage

```javascript
import react from 'react';
```

## Reflection

The project goal included utilizing technologies learned up until this point, while also gaining knowledge and usage of new packages/tools.

Written in both Java and Javascript. Technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Axios. Also Bootstrap, and CSS. Utilized create-react-app due to ease of usage and time effectiveness.

Issues during production sourced from lack of understanding Java, and Springboot as a Framework. Spent 2 of the 4 project days on targeting that weakness alone. Felt I needed a stronger foundation before I jumped into the CRUD aspect of the application.
